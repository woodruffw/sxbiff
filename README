sxbiff is xbiff with signals.

If your MUA doesn't have a spool/mailfile for xbiff to monitor,
you can use sxbiff instead:

$ kill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof sxbiff) # raise the mailbox flag
$ kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof sxbiff) # lower the mailbox flag

Alternatively, clicking the sxbiff window while the flag is raised will
lower it.

BUILDING:

sxbiff requires X11's development headers. These are usually packaged
as libX11-dev or something similar.

Once the development headers are installed:

$ git clone https://github.com/woodruffw/sxbiff && cd sxbiff
$ make

RUNNING:

sxbiff takes no arguments and runs on $DISPLAY.

$ ./sxbiff
